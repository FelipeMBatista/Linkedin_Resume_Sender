# Linkedin_Resume_Sender
This is a project using selenium that opens in your browser a Linkedin's job page that you provide, filtered by your interest.
This is pretty simple, she clicks on each job offer and clicks the "Save" button for you to apply later. I chose not to send the resume directly.
The automation is not completely complete, as it would be necessary to click on the "Save" button to save the job offers with the .click() function.
